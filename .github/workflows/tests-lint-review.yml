    # This needs to be configured more in detail: test-cases are typically
    # coming from various external sources or are intentionally not
    # adhering to lint rules as they expose a particular problem.
    # Also, tests are typically named dut.sv, which typically does not
    # match the module inside.
    # It is probably more worthwhile to apply lint rules offline than
    # commenting on pull requests which mostly results in non-actionable
    # suggestions, increasing noise. Until the details are figured out:
    # disable this for now.
